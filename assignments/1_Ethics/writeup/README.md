### Part 2 (75 pts)

I believe it would be for the best if the exploit was not revealed to the public or even consumer watchdogs. If the exploit was public knowledge it would only attract more attention to those who would seek to exploit it. I would however inform my boss about the exploit as I believe that the issue must be resolved as soon as possible. Fixing the exploit will no doubt take a lot of time, money, and manpower, a cost that an executive may see as to great a cost. However, I believe that the cost is worth it, as the exploit will almost certainly be discovered, whether the company goes public about the issue or not. Once the exploit is discovered it could cost the company a great deal in damages, and ruin the company's reputation. The company will likely be required to fix the exploit at that point, so I believe it would be best to resolve the exploit before it incurs these losses.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Though I believe that the exploit should be resolved as quickly as possible, if the company decides not to put the resources into fixing it, then I should not take action into my own hands. It could possibly be illegal for me to work on the exploit without permission from the company. Even if it wasn't there would be little a single developer could do if my estimate of 6 extra months with 20 developers working on the issue is correct.

If I do nothing then I do believe that I am in some way responsible for the damages, if I knew about the exploit and didn't say anything then it is 100% on me. However, if I have reported the issues to my boss and/or executives and they refuse to take action, then I believe the blame would be shifted on the people who decided not to resolve the exploit.
