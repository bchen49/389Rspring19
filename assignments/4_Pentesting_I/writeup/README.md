## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

The flag is "CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}". This flag was found in the home folder of the webserver. The exact input I used was ";cd home;cat flag.txt". I discovered that if I put a semicolon at the beginning of the input, the application would run the DNS lookup before allowing for more inputs. By chaining statements together with semicolons, I could traverse through the server files.  I used the "dir" command to look at different folders, until I found flag.txt in the "home" folder. Once I found the file I could use the "cd" command into the home folder, and use "cat file.txt" to output the flag. To v0idcache, I would suggest sanatizing any input the DNS lookup service takes in.  For example, escape character symbols such as ";","|", and "&", to prevent an attacker from chaining statements after the expected IP address input.

### Part 2 (60 pts)

Using the python application, we can create an interactive shell, where we can use the same vulnerability from Part 1 to run commands on v0idcache's server. However, unlike in Part 1 where we telnet in and then enter in commands through the DNS lookup application, the python application lets us interact with the web server as if it were our own.
